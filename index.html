		<h2>Cities I've lived</h2>
		<p>Most of my early moves were for my mom's job. After I turned 18, I left Canada for college and spent the next five years in Baltimore. After that, I moved wherever jobs and relationships took me.</p>

		<h2>Citites I'd like to visit</h2>
		<p>I've always wanted to see Iceland, not only because Eve Online is made tehre, but that helps. I want to go to New Zealand to pretend I live in Middle Earth and also to take over a hobbit hole. An old roommate talked me into going to Korea someday, the food is probably delicious.</p>

			<li><em>Auckland</em></li>
